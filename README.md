  ## Description
  In this excersice I demonstrated the ability to create a fully functioning backend for a social networking site. This project makes use of MongoDB as a database to house the information, and the express package to handle the routing. With the capabilities included you can add new users to the database, add friends, thoughts, and reactions to those thoughts in one cohesive environment.
